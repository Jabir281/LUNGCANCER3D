Session Log - December 31, 2025
================================

Summary of Activities
---------------------

1.  **Updated RunPod Instructions (`RUNPOD_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)**
    *   Replaced the local SCP transfer method with a direct Google Drive download using `gdown`.
    *   Added specific instructions for installing `gdown` and `unzip` on the RunPod instance.
    *   Clarified the data extraction process to handle nested zip files (`subset0.zip`, etc.) inside `luna16_processed.zip`.
    *   Added a "Cleanup" section to remove zip files and save disk space.
    *   Added an "After Training" section detailing how to download the model and terminate the pod to avoid excess billing.

2.  **Fixed Training Script (`train.py`)**
    *   Resolved a PyTorch `FutureWarning` regarding `torch.cuda.amp.autocast`. Updated the code to use the modern `torch.amp.autocast('cuda')` syntax.

3.  **Created Model Download Utility (`download_model.ipynb`)**
    *   Created a notebook to verify the existence of `best_model.pth` and generate a clickable download link within the Jupyter interface.

4.  **Created Visualization Tool (`visualize_prediction.ipynb`)**
    *   Developed a notebook to run inference on the local machine.
    *   Implemented logic to load the trained model (`best_model.pth`).
    *   Added functionality to read sample `.npy` files directly from the `luna16_processed.zip` archive without needing to extract it first.
    *   Visualizes the middle slice of the 3D scan and prints the model's prediction (Cancer vs. Normal).

5.  **Created Training Analysis Tool (`plot_training_curves.ipynb`)**
    *   Created a notebook to parse the raw text logs from the training terminal (`training_logs.txt`).
    *   Generates plots for Loss, Accuracy, and AUC over epochs to visualize model performance.

6.  **Updated Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)**
    *   Added missing dependencies: `gdown`, `matplotlib`, `ipykernel`, `ipywidgets`.

Status
------
*   **Training:** Instructions are set for RunPod execution.
*   **Inference:** Local visualization notebook is ready and tested to work with the zip file.
*   **Documentation:** Model details and session logs have been generated.
